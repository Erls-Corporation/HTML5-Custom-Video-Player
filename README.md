<p>This project is 85% finished, but still needs a bit of sprucing up. Nonetheless, it should work just fine for you, and the nice thing is that this player: </p>

<ul>
<li> is 100% skinnable </li>
<li> has full screen support </li>
<li> allows for Flash-fallback, for older browsers </li>
</ul>

<h2> On the To-Do List </h2>
<ol>
	<li> Volume controls (though I personally never use them) </li>
	<li> Time Tracker </li>
</ol>
